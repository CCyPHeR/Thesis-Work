abstract = {We show that the gas-liquid flow pattern in a single gas-evolving electrochemical channel can be remarkably different from the flow pattern in multiple submerged gas-evolving electrochemical channels. This is due to the fact that in a single channel there is a higher accumulation of small bubbles and these can considerably affect the liquid velocity pattern which in turn may affect the performance of a cell. Since experimental work is often carried out in single channels, while industrial applications almost always involve multiple channels, this study provides insight into the factors that affect the flow pattern in each situation and establishes the basis for relating the behavior of single-and multiple-channel devices.},

@article{Gadgil2018,
abstract = {Increasing CO2 levels in the atmosphere due to over-dependence on fossil fuels is a growing concern. Its alarming impact on global climate has prompted the United Nations (UN) to set up its sustainable goal of carbon-neutrality. Electrochemical reduction of CO2 (ERC) is one of the solutions of carbon neutral cy- cle, which can be driven by renewable energy sources for utilizing CO2 to produce high energy density fuels/feedstocks. In this way, CO2 becomes a carbon source for the production of renewable fuels/feedstocks. However, ERC in aqueous solutions is a severely mass-transfer limited process, mainly due to low CO2 solu- bility in such solutions. Flow-cells have been found to be promising in mitigating this problem as compared to H-cells, making them more suitable for the commercial realization of ERC. Moreover, high pressures and continuous flow of electrolyte have been shown to lower the mass-transfer limitations. However, their simultaneous influence on ERC in flow-cells has not been explicitly analyzed. This work primarily focuses on ERC using tin (Sn) electrodes, in which formate is the main product of interest. During ERC in aqueous electrolytes, CO2 is known to undergo an electrode reaction aswell as a homogeneous reaction. This dual action increases the modeling complexity. In this study, a simplified analytical 1D model is developed to find the conditions under which the previously mentioned CO2 homogeneous reaction can be safely neglected. It is found that CO2 can be assumed to undergo only the electrode reaction at low current densities (lower than 7 mA/cm2). However, the current densities for commercial realization are about 100- 200 mA/cm2, which therefore requires incorporating the CO2 homogeneous reactions in the model. Therefore, a multiphysics model of a flow-cell is developed. The model demonstrates how different pressures, velocities and cell potentials influence the current densities and the faradaic efficiencies of different products as well as pH near the cathode (surface pH). At atmospheric pressure, for a constant cell potential, increasing the velocity by an order of magnitude is observed not only to increase the faradaic efficiency of formate by about 20{\%} but it is also found to lower the surface pH. In addition, at a fixed velocity, to maintain a constant faradaic efficiency of formate at high total current densities (for instance, 100 mA/cm2) requires using higher pressures. The results from this work will help future modeling studies to simplify their models when inves- tigating low current densities, and it will guide the experimental studies on flow-cells to select appropriate operating conditions.},

abstract = {Bernaise (Binary ElectRohydrodyNAmIc SolvEr) is a flexible high-level finite element solver of two-phase electrohydrodynamic flow in complex geometries. Two-phase flow with electrolytes is relevant across a broad range of systems and scales, from 'lab-on-a-chip' devices for medical diagnostics to enhanced oil recovery at the reservoir scale. For the strongly coupled multi-physics problem, we employ a recently developed thermodynamically consistent model which combines a generalized Nernst-Planck equation for ion transport, the Poisson equation for electrostatics, the Cahn-Hilliard equation for the phase field (describing the interface separating the phases), and the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow. As an efficient alternative to solving the coupled system of partial differential equations in a monolithic manner, we present a linear, decoupled numerical scheme which sequentially solves the three sets of equations. The scheme is validated by comparison to limiting cases where analytical solutions are available, benchmark cases, and by the method of manufactured solution. The solver operates on unstructured meshes and is therefore well suited to handle arbitrarily shaped domains and problem set-ups where, e.g., very different resolutions are required in different parts of the domain. Bernaise is implemented in Python via the FEniCS framework, which effectively utilizes MPI and domain decomposition, and should therefore be suitable for large-scale/high-performance computing. Further, new solvers and problem set-ups can be specified and added with ease to the Bernaise framework by experienced Python users.},

abstract = {The present paper focuses on Vertical Plane Electrode Reactors with Gas Electrogeneration, VPERGEs, which are involved in various industrial applications in large scale productions. It is well known that the efficiency of such electrochemical reactors is closely linked to the hydrodynamics of the electrogenerated bubbles which act as moving electrical insulators. Therefore, an accurate understanding of the two-phase flow hydrodynamics in these reactors is of prime importance to optimise their geometry and operation.However, the small inter-electrode space in VPERGEs is problematic for both experimental and numerical (CFD) investigations. In fact, because of the narrowness of the gap separating the electrodes, many key aspects of the multiphase flow field are inaccessible to experimental measurements, while on the other hand, CFD models typically used nowadays are at the limit of validity.This paper presents a review of articles dealing with experimental and numerical investigations of the flow in VPERGE reactors that were classified into four reactors type depending on their geometry and on the operating conditions. Such classification is necessary to enable extracting general information on the flow features. Focus is put in particularly on the advantages and drawbacks of the experimental techniques and numerical approaches encountered in the literature.},

Ionic species concentrations are shown to be essentially homogeneous as the mixing effect of the bubble suspension usually is much larger than dispersion by molecular diffusion even at laminar flow conditions.

This means that increasingly the total social milieu is taken into account in the educational process. When it was found that it would be impossible to collect the materials necessary for a number devoted to war and its moral equivalent, it seemed that one of the best substitutes would be a presentation by the Department of Early Childhood and Elementary Education of what their goals and objectives were.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Chemical Society. Nanostructured CO 2 reduction catalysts now achieve near-unity reaction selectivity at increasingly improved Tafel slopes and low overpotentials. With excellent surface reaction kinetics, these catalysts encounter CO 2 mass transport limitations at current densities ca. 20 mA cm -2 . We show here that - in addition to influencing reaction rates and local reactant concentration - the morphology of nanostructured electrodes enhances long-range CO 2 transport via their influence on gas-evolution. Sharper needle morphologies can nucleate and release bubbles as small as 20 $\mu$m, leading to a 4-fold increase in the limiting current density compared to a nanoparticle-based catalyst alone. By extending this observation into a diffusion model that accounts for bubble-induced mass transport near the electrode's surface, diffusive transport can be directly linked to current densities and operating conditions, identifying efficient routes to  {\textgreater} 100 mA cm -2 production. We further extend this model to study the influence of mass transport on achieving simultaneously high selectivity and current density of C2 reduction products, identifying precise control of the local fluid environment as a crucial step necessary for producing C2 over C1 products.},

abstract = {Bubble column reactors are widely employed in various applications. Nowadays computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provides the state-of-the-art capabilities of simulating the hydrodynamics in these reactors. In the present work, bubble column is numerically simulated by using open source CFD tool, OpenFOAM 2.3.1. Euler-Euler two-fluid model is used for the simulations. In the first part, OpenFOAM simulations are validated with experimental data from the literature over a column diameter range of 138–600 mm and the superficial gas velocity in the range of 19–169 mm/s. The velocity and holdup patterns as well as circulation patterns in the bubble column are compared. In addition, Fluent{\textregistered} simulations are performed for the same conditions in order to compare the accuracy of OpenFOAM solvers. In the second part of the work, the validated OpenFOAM solver is applied to simulate the flow field in the 120 mm ID bubble column with and without internals. The internals consisted of (a) one vertical central rod of 36 mm diameter, (b) one central rod of (a) and four vertical additional rods of 12 mm diameter, (c) one central rod of (a) and fourteen vertical additional rods of 12 mm diameter. The OpenFOAM simulations are found to be in good agreement with the experimental data for both bubble columns with and without internals. As regards to experiments, radial profiles of gas hold-up and the liquid velocity were measured by using the radioactive particle technique (RPT). Such measurements were made at four axial locations.},

abstract = {This article presents a mathematical model that predicts the chemical conditions at the electrode surface during the electrochemical reduction of CO2. Such electrochemical reduction of CO2 to valuable products is an area of interest for the purpose of reducing green house gas emissions. In the reactions involved, CO2 acts as both a reactant and a buffer, consequently the estimation of local concentrations at the electrode surface is not trivial and a numerical approach is required. The necessary partial differential equations (PDEs) have been set-up and solved using MATLAB. The results show the local concentrations at the electrode surface to be significantly different from the bulk concentrations under typical reported experimental conditions. The importance of buffer strength and a careful quantification of the degree of mixing produced in the experimental apparatus is demonstrated. The model has also been used to re-examine previously published data, showing that the Tafel slopes in CO2 reduction are consistent with those reported for the simpler CO reduction system. Further, the effect of pulsed electroreduction was also modeled, showing that pulsing causes corresponding swings in local pH and CO2 concentrations.},

abstract = {The importance of the fluid dynamics in the modelling of electrochemical systems is often underestimated. The knowledge of the flow velocity pattern in an electrochemical cell, in fact, can allow us to associate certain electrochemical reactions with specific fluid patterns to maximize the yield of some reaction and, conversely, to minimize unwanted or side reactions. The correct evaluation of the convective term in the Nernst-Planck equation, however, requires the solution of the so-called Navier-Stokes equations, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is today the established method to numerically solve these equations. In this work, a CFD model is employed to show that the gas-liquid flow pattern can be remarkably different in a single channel or in a multi-channel gas-evolving electrochemical system. In the single channel, in fact, under certain conditions, vortices and recirculation regions can appear in the flow, which does not appear in the multi-channel case. The reason of this difference is found in the uneven distribution of the small bubbles in the two cases. Additionally, a second, simplified, model of the flow is discussed to show how a higher concentration of small bubbles in the single channel system can destabilize the flow. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.},

The cell con-sisted of two parallel vertical electrodes, upon one of which chlorine gas evolved and the other where the mass-transfer-controlled reduction of dissolved chlorine occurred. Two mechanisms contributed to the enhancement of mass transfer: circulation due to the nonuniform distribution of bubbles and stirring caused by the rising bubbles. The average mass-transfer coefficient generally decreased with increasing cell gap, except at a cell gap of about 0.5 cm where a local maxi-mum occurred. The local mass-transfer coefficient increased nonlinearly with height.

The governing differential equations are developed and the results of the numerical analysis are presented and discussed in light of the assumed distribution of the void fraction.

It introduces basic examples of partial differential equations, arising in continuum mechanics, electromagnetism, complex analysis and other areas, and develops a number of tools for their solution, including particularly Fourier analysis, distribution theory, and Sobolev spaces. These tools are applied to the treatment of basic problems in linear PDE, including the Laplace equation, heat equation, and wave equation, as well as more general elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic equations. Volume I prepares the way for studies of more advanced topics in linear PDE, in Volume 2, and for studies of nonlinear PDE, in Volume 3. The book is addressed to graduate students in mathematics and to professional mathematicians, with an interest in partial differential equations, mathematical physics, differential geometry, harmonic analysis, and complex analysis.},

A numerical mixture model is used in order to resolve the two dimensional bubble plumes evolving along the electrodes. Plumes thickness sensitivity is studied for various parameters, such as bubble diameter, electrolyte viscosity, electrochemical cell geometry and current density. Using thermal buoyancy driven flow analogy, a dimensionless Rayleigh-like number R$\alpha$f,e is defined to predict the behavior of the wall-bounded gas convection between two vertical facing electrodes. Different bubbles dispersion mechanisms are observed depending on two-phase flow dynamics and physical properties of the mixture. The effect of forced convection in the channel is also investigated. A scaling law for plume thickness evolution for a large range of Prandtl-equivalent number values is proposed. These results show that the bubble plume can be efficiently controlled by an imposed electrolyte velocity.},

The model solves transport equations for both phases with an allowance of interphase mass and momentum exchange. The effect of current density and bubble size on the gas release rate, velocity field and void fraction distribution are investigated in a range of parameter. The flow in the system was generated due to the density difference between gas and liquid phases. It is found that both current density and bubble size significantly affect the gas release rate and velocity field. At an intermediate current density two circulation patterns form at the vicinity of the free surface. The circulations rotating opposite directions enhance lateral diffusion of gas phase.

The gas is produced electrochemically according to Faraday's law. However, the growth of gas bubbles on the electrode surface affects the area available for electrochemical reactions. The description of the electrochemically active surface as a function of the bubble activity on a gas-evolving electrode is the main topic of this chapter. This understanding will allow us to derive an evolution equation for the bubble coverage fraction of the electrode during electrolysis. This equation will have important applications in the description of electrochemical discharges. },

Reynolds stress models have only rarely been explored in this context, although effects requiring this level of description are frequently encountered in industrial applications towards which the Euler–Euler approach is geared. In particular, source terms describing the additional bubble-induced contribution to the liquid phase turbulence with proper account for its anisotropy have not firmly been established yet. A formulation based on the direction of bubble motion relative to the liquid is given here. Two well-known variants of Reynolds stress models due to Launder, Reece and Rodi and Speziale, Sarkar and Gatski are compared. Closure relations for the bubble forces are applied that have been shown previously to work well over a range of conditions. The model is validated by comparison with a set of pipe flow data that contains variations of liquid and gas flow rates as well as different pipe diameters. An important criterion for the selection of the data was to provide measurements of individual components of the Reynolds stress tensor.},

A theoretical analysis on the basis of fundamental relationships shows that the increase in potential-commonly associated with the so-called anode effect at cells with constant or varied current-is caused in some cases by limitation of mass transfer. In other cases it is the result of reaching a summit current value created by the presence of gas bubbles in contact with the electrode surface. Which of the causes is the controlling one depends on the bulk concentration of the reacting substance and on the state of the electrode surface, particularly on material and roughness directly acting on the wettability. It is not sufficient to attribute any uncontrolled potential increase solely to mass transfer control as hitherto done. Several types must be taken into consideration. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Modeling of bubble-induced turbulence in dispersed gas-liquid multiphase flow is an important but still unresolved issue. Aside from its intrinsic interest, turbulence in this type of flow has a strong impact on other important processes like turbulent dispersion of the bubbles and bubble-coalescence and -breakup and thus is a central part of the overall model. Especially the latter require as input values of turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation, which as shown subsequently are not readily obtained from the most common approach to add a bubble-induced contribution to the effective viscosity. This may be overcome by including source terms in the single phase two-equation turbulence models that describe the bubble effects on the liquid turbulence. However, no consensus on the precise form of these terms has been reached yet. We here report a comparison of different models of this type. Special care has been given to the selection of a rather comprehensive set of reference data allowing to qualify the validity of the different models. Conclusions towards best practice guidelines for modeling bubbly turbulence are drawn and needs for further research identified. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

A problem admitting analytical solution, previously solved by domain-meshing techniques, is used to assess the accuracy of the present approach, obtaining satisfactory results.

Three pairs of Luggin-Haber probes were positioned near the anode and the cathode to determine the solution IR drop during electrolysis. A sectioned electrode having 10 segments was employed to obtain the current distribution from the bottom to the top of cell. The superficial resistivity of the solution containing gas bubbles agreed well with the Bruggemann equation. The solution IR drop decreased significantly when adequate conditions or cell geometry for solution circulation were provided. The anode-to-cathode gap was found to be the most important parameter for reduction of the solution IR drop in a vertical cell. {\textcopyright} 1980, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.

@article{Baczyzmalski2015,
abstract = {Chemical energy storage systems, e.g., in the form of hydrogen or methanol, have a great potential for the establishment of volatile renewable energy sources due to the large energy density. The efficiency of hydrogen production through water electrolysis is, however, limited by gas bubbles evolving at the electrode's surface and can be enhanced by an accelerated bubble detachment. In order to characterize the complex multi-phase flow near the electrode, simultaneous measurements of the fluid velocities and the size and trajectories of hydrogen bubbles were performed in a water electrolyzer. The liquid phase velocity was measured by PIV/PTV, while shadowgraphy was used to determine the bubble trajectories. Special measurement and evaluation techniques had to be applied as the measurement uncertainty is strongly affected by the high void fraction close to the wall. In particular, the application of an advanced PTV scheme allowed for more precise fluid velocity measurements closer to electrode. Based on these data, stability characteristics of the near-wall flow were evaluated and compared to that of a wall jet. PTV was used as well to investigate the effect of Lorentz forces on the near-wall fluid velocities. The results show a significantly increased wall parallel liquid phase velocity with increasing Lorentz forces. It is presumed that this enhances the detachment of hydrogen bubbles from the electrode surface and, consequently, decreases the fractional bubble coverage and improves the efficiency. In addition, the effect of large rising bubbles with path oscillations on the near-wall flow was investigated. These bubbles can have a strong impact on the mass transfer near the electrode and thus affect the performance of the process.},

@article{Buffo2017,
abstract = {In this work we use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate a reactive gas–liquid bubbly system in a rectangular bubble column, operating at low superficial velocities (i.e. homogeneous regime). The gas bubbles, injected in the column through a sparger, contain one of the reactants, namely CO2, that via mass transfer moves to the continuous liquid phase, where it reacts with NaOH. A key role is played by the bubble size distribution (BSD) and the specific surface area that define the overall mass transfer rate in the CFD model. In order to correctly predict the BSD and the polydispersity of the bubbly system the population balance equation is solved by the quadrature method of moments (QMOM), within the OpenFOAM (v. 2.2.x) two-fluid solver compressibleTwoPhaseEulerFoam. To reduce the computational time and increase stability, a second-order operator-splitting technique for the solution of the chemically reactive species is also implemented, allowing to solve the different processes involved with their own time-scale. To our knowledge this is the first time that QMOM is employed for the simulation of a real reactive bubbly system and predictions are validated against experiments.},

@article{Askari2018,
abstract = {In order to optimize and design new bubbly flow reactors, it is necessary to predict the bubble behavior and properties with respect to the time and location. In gas-liquid flows, it is easily observed that the bubble sizes may vary widely. The bubble size distribution is relatively sharply defined, and bubble rises are uniform in homogeneous flow; however bubbles aggregate, and large bubbles are formed rapidly in heterogeneous flow. To assist in the analysis of these systems, the volume, size and other properties of dispersed bubbles can be described mathematically by distribution functions. Therefore, a mathematical modeling tool called the Population Balance Model (PBM) is required to predict the distribution functions of the bubble motion and the variation of their properties. In the present paper, two rectangular bubble columns and a water electrolysis reactor are modeled using the open-source Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) package OpenFOAM. Furthermore, the Method of Classes (CM) and Quadrature-based Moments Method (QBMM) are described, implemented and compared using the developed CFD-PBM solver. These PBM tools are applied in two bubbly flow cases: bubble columns (using a Eulerian-Eulerian two-phase approach to predict the flow) and a water electrolysis reactor (using a single-phase approach to predict the flow). The numerical results are compared with measured data available in the scientific literature. It is observed that the Extended Quadrature Method of Moments (EQMOM) leads to a slight improvement in the prediction of experimental measurements and provides a continuous reconstruction of the Number Density Function (NDF), which is helpful in the modeling of gas evolution electrodes in the water electrolysis reactor.},

The model was used to simulate the gas-solid flow behavior inside a circulating fluidized bed riser operating at various superficial gas velocities and solids mass fluxes in two fluidization regimes, a dilute phase transport (DPT) regime and a fast fluidization (FF) regime. The simulation results were evaluated based on comparison with experimental data of solids velocity and holdup, obtained from non-invasive automated radioactive particle tracking and gamma-ray tomography techniques, respectively. The agreement of the predicted solids velocity and holdup with experimental data validated the CPFD model for the CFB riser. The model predicted the main features of the gas-solid flows in the two regimes; the uniform dilute phase in the DPT regime, and the coexistence of the dilute phase in the upper region and the dense phase in the lower region in the FF regime. The clustering and solids back mixing in the FF regime were stronger than those in the DPT regime. {\textcopyright} 2012 China University of Petroleum (Beijing) and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},
